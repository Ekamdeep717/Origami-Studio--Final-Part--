    <h4>How to make it?</h4>

<p>1. Fold your paper in half to create a mountain fold, 
open out and fold in half again this time the opposite way</p>

<p>2. Open out and fold along both diagonals making two more mountain folds.</p>

<p> 3. Flip it over and lift the bottom corner up. 
You want to fold it past the top edge so the tip of the triangle extends 
over the top. Flatten the center but not the edges of the crease.</p>
     
<p>4.Fold the tip of the triangle over and crease.
If you're using anything thicker than origami paper 
you may need to use a little glue to hold this flap down.</p>

  <p> 5. To finish fold the butterfly in half to help shape it.
All you have to do now is
 find a place to display your origami butterfly and enjoy.</p>
